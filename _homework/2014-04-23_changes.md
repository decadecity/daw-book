Note on <abbr>:

This is the way to mark up an abbreviation, the title attribute gives the full version.  I think I've been a bit trigger happy with them in some places and, reading it back I now don't like them, so when I spot them I'm taking them out :-)

10/20 - updated last paragraph with more information.

20/10:
 * added notes to sections that provide more information.

40/21 - updated with your feedback.

40/32 - This is a very early blog post, I don't think I'd really found my style at this point.  I need to re-write this whole section.
