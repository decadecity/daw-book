## Progressive enhancement
What is Progressive enhancement?  We start with a solid foundation and enhance from there.

### Elements of a web page

  1. HTML(Content)
  2. CSS (Presentation)
  3. JavaScript (Behaviour)

The traditional view of progressive enhancement is that you start with the HTML for the content, add CSS for the presentation and finally add on JavaScript for the behaviour.

This separation of concerns should, of course, be the the foundation for any site but we can do more:  We can also apply progressive enhancement **within** each of these elements.
