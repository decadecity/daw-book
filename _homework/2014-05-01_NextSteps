Hi, 

I figured there wasn't much point in giving you next steps until after Dot York was over (especially since you're looking at the TechMeetup as well), but here it is, in case you want a look before you come home at the weekend. 

Generally I think it's coming together nicely and you'll have something that's really useful to the community at the end of this. 

When we start to look more closely at making sure it's one piece, I'd like to look especially at the 'bullet point' aspect of it. There are quite a few places where, although there are no actual bullet points, it reads as if there were. Just a sentence either side of some of them would work wonders in terms of making it flow like a narrative, rather than a collection of (very pertinent) points of best practise. 

That's really for later, but I thought I'd mention it now so you can keep it mind while you're writing new bits. 

Thank you very much for the changes file - very handy. I'll keep working through the them all between now and Wednesday, but until then, your next steps are enjoying the conference, networking like crazy and telling everyone you're writing a book. And if you get to some work on the performance section before Monday that would be great. (I know, I'm being very nice and not setting you much, but I figure you have other things to do this week!)

See you on Wednesday. Illegal Jacks for lunch again? Or something different?
