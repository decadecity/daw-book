# What is "The Device Agnostic Web"?

"Agnostic" is a big word - what does it mean? It's faux Greek for "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agnostic">not knowing</a>".

So what is the "<strong>device agnostic web</strong>"? It means we don't know what device will be used to interact with our site.

But isn't that just "The Web", right? No. There are plenty of people out there who try to control which browsers interact with their sites:

(This is a whole load of fails concentrated in one place. The Carphone Warehouse aren't a warehouse and they don't sell carphones. They sell mobile phones and this is the product page for a mobile phone when viewed on that self same mobile phone.)

## How bad is this problem?

A survey carried out in 2013 by Pure Oxygen Labs, a mobile consulting and technology company, found that nearly half of the top 100 American companies are trying to control which browsers interact with their sites - again by trying to target mobile phones with a dedicated site - and none of them were getting it right as judged by <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/details">Google's mobile site requirements</a>. These guidelines aren't exactly rocket surgery - they basically say "don't break the web" [link to misc article] and yet people still can't manage it.

## It's not just mobile phones

This problem is probably highest profile with mobile phones but there are an awful lot of things out there interacting with web sites. We've got tablets, games consoles, smart televisions, screen readers, search engine spiders, glasses and even watches - and they vary greatly in their capabilities.

Listed below are some of the capabilities we might typically expect from different types of devices.  It's important to note that these are merely examples, not a hard and fast categorisation.

### Screen readers and search engine spiders

 * Words only - no typography, colour, graphics or visuals.

### Wearable devices

 * Very small screen size.
 * Effectively fixed orientation.
 * Limited interaction capabilities.

### Low end smart phones

 * Low processing power.
 * Low resolution screens.
 * Often using outdated or limited browsers.

### Smart televisions

 * Low processing power.
 * Fixed orientation.
 * Fixed location and therefore viewing distance.

### Desktop and laptop computers

 * High processing power.
 * Medium to large screen size but effectively fixed orientation.
 * Latest browser support available (although not always used).

### High end smart phones and tablets

 * High processing power, sometimes better than older laptops.
 * High resolution screens.
 * Multiple inputs including touch, keyboard, location, camera, microphone, etc.
