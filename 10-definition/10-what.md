# What is "The Device Agnostic Web"?

"Agnostic" is a big word - what does it mean?  It's faux Greek for "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agnostic">not knowing</a>".

So what is the "<strong>device agnostic web</strong>"?  It means we don't know what device will be used to interact with our site.

But isn't that just "The Web", right?  No.  There are plenty of people out there who try to control which browsers interact with their sites:

(This is a whole load of fails concentrated in one place.  The Carphone Warehouse aren't a warehouse and they don't sell carphones.  They sell mobile phones and this is the product page for a mobile phone when viewed on that self same mobile phone.)

## How bad is this problem?

In a survey carried out in 2013 it was found that nearly half of the top 100 American companies are trying to control which browsers interact with their sites - again by trying to target mobile phones with a dedicated site - and none of them were getting it right as judged by <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/details">Google's mobile site requirements</a>.  These guidelines aren't exactly rocket surgery - they basically say "don't break the web" [link to misc article] and yet people still can't manage it.

## It's not just mobile phones

This problem is probably highest profile with mobile phones but there are an awful lot of things out there that are interacting with web sites.  We've got tablets, games consoles, smart televisions, screen readers, search engine spiders, glasses and even watches - and they vary greatly in capabilities. [expand]
