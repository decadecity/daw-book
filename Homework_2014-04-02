Homework

(We can call it something else if you prefer - I have a client who loaths that word, but really likes 'corework'. Whatever works for you.)

## I'll set homework on Wednesdays and request that it's submitted to me by 6pm on Mondays. 

Do those days work for you? If not, we can shuffle them around a bit. We should also schedule a time for our face to face session later in the month. I'm guessing after the conference would be better. (I also think you should mine the conference for stuff for the book, and plug the book shamelessly throughout! But I'm sure you've already thought of that.) 

I'm going to read through the rest of what you have so far this afternoon and add comments into those files. 

The only thing I'm a little bit worried about is sometimes I've had clients make things worse with their revisions and have to go back to a previous version. I'm assuming that's possible with this, but just want to check before we get totally lost in it.

## So. Here's your homework. 

1. Expand Chapter 1 - perhaps give examples of the frustraion of users trying to read things that don't work on their device. Almost definitely give facts on the number of aborted 'purchases' (could be sales, could be sign ups or opt ins) that arise because the site won't let the user click on the right link, or whatever. If such facts are available. If not - I see no reason why you can't make it up, as long as you're clear about the fact that you've made it up.) 

2. Write Chapter 2 - why we should build for the device agnostic web. This will link very nicely from the ending of Chapter 2 - the two may even merge into on larger whole. That's ok. 

3. Expand Chapter 3 - Performance

4. Consider an introduction that describes who you're talking to with this book. Because it's so clearly written, I can see it being recommended as a primer for 'higher ups', so they can get a handle on what the developers are trying to do. Not sure if you want to consider this angle? It might mean you need to just add in a couple of extra bits here and there. (Eg, when discussing 'performance budget' - for me, website performace = lead conversion - clearly that's not what you mean. A couple of extra sentences helps that 'on the sidelines' reader to still get their head around it quickly.)

5. Let me know when would be a good time to meet up later this month.

That's quite a lot to be going on for this week. I'll send you an email with this in as well, so you have a prompt somewhere else.

Think that's everything. Remember, if you have any questions or get stuck at any point, give me a shout.
Speak soon,
S
