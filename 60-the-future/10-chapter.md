# The future
What's going to happen in the future?  **Learn from the past.**

Code you wrote in the past is now living in the future.  Look at how that's working in new browsers.

 * What did you do that worked?  Do more of that!
 * What did you do that broke?  Don't do that again.

Browsers are very good at dealing with old websites, if you've built your site to be compatible with older browsers then it's a safe bet that new browsers will be able to handle it.

## Be general, not specific
The more general you make your code the less likely it is to cause you problems.  If your code targets specific browsers then when those browsers change you have to change your code in order to prevent it breaking.

When Google announced Blink and Mozilla announced their Servo rendering engines on the same day this was my reaction:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet boxout"><p>First thought: &quot;Damn! New rendering engines.&quot; Second thought: &quot;I already build device agnostic websites - what do I care?&quot;</p>&mdash; Orde Saunders (@decadecity) <a href="https://twitter.com/decadecity/statuses/319584869191651328">April 3, 2013</a></blockquote>

If you have to change your site when Apple release a new version of one of their products: **you are doing it wrong**.

## Give up control (You never had it anyway)
One of the keys to building in a device agnostic manner is to give up control: You never really had it anyway - you just thought you did.

Whether trying to deliver the same pixel perfect site to every user or delivering reduced functionality to mobile users 'on the go', trying to exert a control we don't have over how our sites are viewed is fighting a losing battle.

I know it can seem a bit scary but once you accept that you don't have control over how your users interact with your site it's actually very liberating - you've got no choice but to get the fundamentals right and, once they're right, you have a lot more freedom with how you build up from there.

## Future Friendly

  1. Acknowledge and embrace unpredictability.
  2. Think and behave in a future-friendly way.
  3. Help others do the same.

Future Friendly is a philosophy that emerged as a positive reaction to the increasing varieties of devices that can be connected in the web.

It acknowledges that the only predictable thing about the future of the web is that it will be unpredictable.

By building in a device agnostic manner we embrace this unpredictability.
