# Testing

  * Test using real devices
  * Focus your testing
  * Use Opera Mini

Building sites this way may sound like you have to do more testing but in fact it should reduce the amount of time you spend doing it. If you build it right, more things should just work, which means fewer defects and less work fixing them. Since you should be testing in multiple devices anyway, this will at least speed things up. 

Emulators are OK but there's no substitute for testing using real devices. There's nothing quite like an entry level smart phone to highlight issues with performance and usability that will be covered up by a top of the range device.

You should focus your testing. There's not really much to be gained by doing a full regression on every device and in every browser. You should think about what could cause a problem and focus on those areas in browsers you know will expose that.

The single best browser for testing is Opera Mini. Due to the way everything is rendered on the server side and sent as a static page to the device it will really test how robustly your site is built. If you site works well in Opera Mini you're probably not going to have any major problems anywhere else.

I'd also suggest booking some time to do some research, take your team down there[1] and have a look at your site, your competitors' sites and other sites from outside your industry. Look at what's working and what's not and use that to inform which direction you take your site.
